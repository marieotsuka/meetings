# Meetings

This was created as a tool to help organize a classroom schedule for meeting with students. 

## How to use

1. Enter or paste in a line-separated list of students.
	- Each name should be on its own line.
2. Specify options.
	- Check whether or not the result should be randomized. This is turned on by default.
	- Select Individual or Group meetings.
 		- If Group, specify the number of groups the students should be divided into.
	- Specify the start and end time.
	- Specify whether or not to account for breaks.
 		- If adding 1 or more break, specify the number of minutes for each break. 
 		- If using grouping, this works best if the number of breaks is one less than the number of groups.
3. Generate Schedule.
	- Calculated schedule will display in the editable textbox.
